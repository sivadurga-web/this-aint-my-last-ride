# This aint my last ride

### **Description :**
>This video game is made by using pure python and pygame only.

It is a 2 player game competeing each other. There are 4 rounds in the game.
>
Score increases by 5 if you cross an obstacle and by 10 for a moving one.
>
The score will be saved even if you die in mid-way.
>
New enemies and no. of obstacles increase after every round.
>
If a player wins a particular round the enemy speed increases in the next round.

### Game design
>Controls :
UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT : for Player1 \
>W A S D : for Player2

## For better gaming experience :
* I have declared 4 dedicated variables for up down left and right...instead of 2 variables
* The collision theory used is pixel perfect rather than distance and AABB .
Which allows narrow escape for the player.
